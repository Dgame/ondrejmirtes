Hi!

I am Ondřej Mirtes. I like pointing out mistakes in other people's code so much that I created [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), a popular open-source static analysis tool that focuses on finding bugs in PHP code without running it.

I maintain [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) and [related packages](https://github.com/phpstan/) as my full-time job. I rely on voluntary donations from individuals and sponsorships from companies to do this work. My list of ideas for PHPStan grows faster than I'm able to check off so I'm looking to be able to devote more time to it.

Does GitHub already have your 💳? Do you use PHPStan to find 🐛 before they reach production? [Send a couple of 💸 a month my way too.](https://github.com/sponsors/ondrejmirtes) Thank you!
